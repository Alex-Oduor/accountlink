# AccountLink – Centralized Financial Account Identity Service

AccountLink is a **secure, centralized financial account identity service** that allows users to link all their **bank accounts and M-Pesa numbers** under a single username. It protects sensitive financial information by **abstracting account details**, while still allowing apps to process payments or retrieve account info.
